# MAGIC # Use Case 3: Long-form Summarization for BI Workflows
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What this notebook does:** Uses `ai_query` with structured response format (`responseFormat => 'STRUCT<...>'`)
# MAGIC to extract typed fields from long-form text — turning unstructured call transcripts into a queryable BI table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What you need to run this:**
# MAGIC - Databricks SQL warehouse (Serverless recommended) or DBR 14.3+
# MAGIC - Unity Catalog + AI Functions enabled
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Estimated cost:** ~1–2 DBU per run (5 long transcripts, larger token count than short-text patterns)

# MAGIC Customer: Honestly we are still evaluating. Our CFO asked us to look at two other options. We like the platform but the price jump at renewal caught us off guard.
# MAGIC Rep: What price delta are we talking about?
# MAGIC Customer: About 40%. We budgeted for 15. Our head of data engineering is actually a big fan and wants to stay but we need to get this down.
# MAGIC Rep: I can get you to commercial by end of week. Can we schedule a call Thursday with your CFO?
# MAGIC Customer: Yes, Thursday afternoon works. Let us say 2pm Pacific.
# MAGIC Rep: Done. I am going to flag this to my manager and see if we can move on multi-year pricing before that call.'

# MAGIC Customer: Really well. We processed 2 million records in about 40 minutes. Our old system took overnight.
# MAGIC Rep: Great. Any blockers before we move to contract?
# MAGIC Customer: One — we need SSO sorted before we can sign. Our infosec team is not going to approve without it.
# MAGIC Rep: SSO is standard in the enterprise tier. I will send you the SAML docs today. How long does infosec usually take?
# MAGIC Customer: If we get them docs this week, probably two weeks review. So we are looking at signing early May.
# MAGIC Rep: Perfect. I will loop in our integration engineer to get you through onboarding fast once signed.'

# MAGIC Customer: We have hit a wall. Our DBT models have hard-coded Snowflake syntax and the refactor is taking longer than expected. We are about 60% done.
# MAGIC Rep: Have you looked at the Databricks migration accelerator?
# MAGIC Customer: We tried it but it did not handle the window function syntax we use heavily. We are basically doing it manually.
# MAGIC Rep: I want to bring in our migration engineering team. They have done this exact pattern for three other customers this quarter. Can we get a technical sync?
# MAGIC Customer: Yes please. If you can get someone on by end of this week that would be incredibly helpful. We have a hard cutover deadline of June 1.'

# MAGIC Customer: Yes, we have been running a small experiment. We are using your AI Functions to classify customer complaint emails. It is working well but we are not sure how to scale it.
# MAGIC Rep: What does your current setup look like?
# MAGIC Customer: One data engineer, running it manually on a sample every Friday. We want to make it daily and connect it to our CRM.
# MAGIC Rep: That is exactly the kind of workflow our SQL warehouse is built for. Let me send you a notebook template.
# MAGIC Customer: That would be great. We are also wondering about cost — we are worried it will get expensive.

# MAGIC Rep: Any concerns going into Q2?
# MAGIC Customer: Two things. One — we are going to need more compute headroom as we onboard three more business units in May. Two — we have a compliance audit in Q3 and need documentation on your data lineage capabilities.
# MAGIC Rep: For compute, I will send you the capacity planning guide and connect you with our platform team. For lineage, Unity Catalog has a full API-level lineage export. I will send you the compliance documentation today.

# MAGIC ## Key behavior to verify
# MAGIC - The `owner` field returns `Rep` or `Customer` — not a first name. The transcripts use role labels ("Rep:", "Customer:") with no personal names, so the prompt explicitly instructs the model to use these labels. If your real transcripts include speaker names, update the prompt to: `owner: first name of the person responsible for the next step`.
# MAGIC - `risk_flag` is a boolean: CALL-001 (price shock + competitive eval) and CALL-003 (hard deadline + blocked migration) are the expected risk rows.
# MAGIC - `deal_stage` values are constrained to the enum in the prompt — the model will not return values outside that list.
# MAGIC - `from_json` is used to flatten the struct because `ai_query` with `responseFormat => STRUCT<...>` returns the inner fields as a JSON string that must be parsed. This is the standard pattern for nested struct extraction in Databricks SQL.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## What to do next
# MAGIC - Point this at `gold.call_transcripts` and schedule it nightly
# MAGIC - `MERGE INTO gold.call_summaries` by `call_id` to keep the table current
# MAGIC - Connect a BI dashboard to filter `WHERE risk_flag = true` for a real-time deal risk view
# MAGIC - Version the prompt by keeping it in a `gold.prompt_registry` table — same change management as your dbt models
