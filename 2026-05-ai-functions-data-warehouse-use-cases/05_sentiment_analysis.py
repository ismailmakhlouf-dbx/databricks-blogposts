# MAGIC # Use Case 5: Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis — Closing the Loop on What Users Actually Think
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What this notebook does:** Uses `ai_analyze_sentiment` + `ai_classify` to turn raw NPS verbatims and
# MAGIC support responses into structured feedback signals — polarity, topic, and urgency in one query.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What you need to run this:**
# MAGIC - Databricks SQL warehouse (Serverless recommended) or DBR 14.3+
# MAGIC - Unity Catalog + AI Functions enabled

# MAGIC ## Key behavior to verify
# MAGIC - `ai_analyze_sentiment` returns `positive`, `negative`, or `mixed` — NOT a numeric score
# MAGIC - A high NPS score (e.g., 7/10) with a `mixed` sentiment is valid — the model captures nuance the score misses
# MAGIC - `ai_classify` and `ai_analyze_sentiment` are independent calls — combine them for compound filters
# MAGIC - **Past-tense cancel signals (NPS-008):** "We moved to a competitor last month" is correctly read as already-churned, so `urgency = low_urgency`. The `cancel_signal` topic still triggers the retention action — urgency does not gate it. This is correct model behavior. If you want all cancel signals treated as `high_urgency` regardless of tense, add a CASE override in the final SELECT: `CASE WHEN topic = 'cancel_signal' THEN 'high_urgency' ELSE urgency END AS urgency`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## What to do next
# MAGIC - Point this at `bronze.nps_responses` and schedule it nightly in your existing pipeline
# MAGIC - `MERGE INTO gold.feedback_classifications` by `response_id`
# MAGIC - Connect a BI alert: `WHERE topic = 'cancel_signal'` fires a daily email to your retention team
# MAGIC - Add `survey_source`, `customer_tier`, and `account_id` for more precise segmentation
