# MAGIC # Use Case 2: Customer Communication Triage - Classifying Tickets and Calls at Scale
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What this notebook does:** Uses `ai_classify` to tag support tickets with intent category and urgency level
# MAGIC in a single SQL query - no model to train, no labels to maintain.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What you need to run this:**
# MAGIC - Databricks SQL warehouse (Serverless recommended) or DBR 14.3+
# MAGIC - Unity Catalog + AI Functions enabled
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Estimated cost:** < 0.3 DBU per run (10 rows, short text)

# MAGIC ## Step 1: Create dummy support tickets

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW demo_support_tickets AS
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM VALUES
# MAGIC   ('TKT-001', 'premium', 'I was charged twice for my subscription this month. Please fix this immediately - I need this resolved today.'),
# MAGIC   ('TKT-002', 'basic', 'The dashboard keeps timing out when I try to export more than 1000 rows. Has been happening for 3 days.'),
# MAGIC   ('TKT-003', 'enterprise', 'We are evaluating your product against competitors. Can you send me pricing for 500 seats?'),
# MAGIC   ('TKT-004', 'basic', 'I am cancelling my subscription. Your support response time is unacceptable.'),
# MAGIC   ('TKT-005', 'premium', 'Just wanted to say the new release is fantastic. The query performance improvements are huge.'),
# MAGIC   ('TKT-006', 'enterprise', 'We are onboarding 200 new users next week and need help setting up SSO. Who should I contact?'),
# MAGIC   ('TKT-007', 'basic', 'How do I reset my password? I cannot find the option in settings.'),
# MAGIC   ('TKT-008', 'premium', 'Our entire data pipeline has been down for 2 hours. We are missing SLA on a client deliverable right now.'),
# MAGIC   ('TKT-009', 'enterprise', 'Can you add dark mode to the UI? Our team works nights and the bright screen is painful.'),
# MAGIC   ('TKT-010', 'premium', 'The API is returning 503 errors intermittently since your maintenance window last night.')

# MAGIC ## Step 2: Classify intent and urgency in one query
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `ai_classify` v2 takes labels as a JSON array string and returns a struct. Append `:response[0]::STRING`
# MAGIC to pull the single label out. v2 supports up to 500 labels and accepts label descriptions; v1 (the
# MAGIC older `ARRAY('label1', 'label2', ...)` form) is being deprecated. Change the labels any time - no retraining.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC SELECT
# MAGIC   ticket_id,
# MAGIC   customer_segment,
# MAGIC   ticket_body,
# MAGIC   ai_classify(
# MAGIC     ticket_body,
# MAGIC     '["billing_issue","technical_outage","product_question","cancel_request","feature_request","praise","sales_inquiry","onboarding"]'
# MAGIC   ):response[0]::STRING AS intent,
# MAGIC   ai_classify(

# MAGIC ## Key behavior to verify
# MAGIC - `ai_classify` is non-deterministic: the same ticket may get different urgency labels across runs. This is expected - urgency is a judgment call, and the model may read the same text slightly differently each time.
# MAGIC - **Cancel requests always route to Retention** regardless of urgency. The CASE checks `intent = 'cancel_request'` first - before any urgency check - so even a ticket classified as `critical` urgency goes to Retention, not PagerDuty. This is intentional: a critical cancel signal is a retention problem, not an outage.
# MAGIC - If you want critical cancel signals to page on-call *and* notify retention, add a second output column for the secondary action instead of relying on a single routing field.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## What to do next
# MAGIC - Replace `demo_support_tickets` with your live `bronze.support_tickets` table
# MAGIC - Schedule this as a nightly SQL job and `MERGE INTO` a `gold.ticket_classifications` table
# MAGIC - Update the label arrays by changing the SQL, not retraining a model
# MAGIC - Add `ai_classify(ticket_body, '["en","fr","de","es","other"]'):response[0]::STRING` to auto-detect language if you have multilingual tickets
